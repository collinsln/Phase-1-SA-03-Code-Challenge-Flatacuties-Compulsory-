# Phase-1-SA-03-Code-Challenge-Flatacuties-Compulsory-
This app This is an app for voting for the cutest animal! I have used a local API and built out the front end for our app, Flatacuties.

As a user, I can:

See all character's names in a div with the id of "character-bar". Create a span tag with the character's name and add it to the div#character-bar once you have retrieved the character data from the server.

When the character in the div#character-bar is clicked, display the character's details in the div#detailed-info.

When the form#votes-form is submitted, add the number of votes from the input field to the character displayed in the div#detailed-info. No persistence is needed.
